# Action SuperCross Python Library

There's no description, no documentation, no installation procedure, no usage examples, no comments in code and no tests. Deal with it.

## Known limitations

Due to a recent bug in construct library replays are always saved in Across 1.2 format, even if they are explicitly set to be Across 1.0. Construct 2.8.8 should fix this problem.
